Introduction
========================

LimeSDR XTRX is high-performance software-defined radio (SDR) board in a compact Mini PCIe form factor. With an AMD Artix™ 7 XC7A50T-2CPG236I FPGA and a Lime Microsystems LMS7002M RF transceiver at its core, LimeSDR XTRX is a perfect platform for developing logic-intensive digital and RF designs. Visit `Crowd Supply <https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr-xtrx>`__ for board purchasing options. 

This guide provides comprehensive information on setting up, configuring, and using your LimeSDR XTRX. It’s structured to cover the key aspects of getting your board up and running effectively, and to support both beginners and advanced users in working with the hardware, software, and gateware components.

How to Use This Documentation
-----------------------------

This page is organized into four main sections, each focusing on a different aspect of working with the development board:

**Getting Started**  
   Begin here if you’re new to the LimeSDR XTRX board or need a quick start. This section provides step-by-step instructions on preparing the hardware, installing essential software, and flashing the necessary gateware. These instructions aim to get your board operational with minimal setup time, so you can focus on exploring its capabilities.

**Hardware**  
   This section dives deeper into the board's hardware components, providing detailed information about specifications, pin configurations, and peripheral interfaces. It’s ideal if you want to understand the full capabilities of the board or need to connect additional components.

**Software**  
   Here, you’ll find details on setting up the development environment, including software libraries, SDKs, and supported operating systems. This section is especially useful for configuring advanced features, developing applications, and troubleshooting software-related issues.

**Gateware**  
   For users needing customization at the gateware level, this section covers the design and programming of FPGA or configurable logic elements. You’ll learn how to modify, compile, and deploy gateware, allowing you to tailor the board’s functionality to specific needs.

Suggested Reading Order
-----------------------

We recommend starting with the **Getting Started** section, where you’ll find the essentials to set up the board quickly. Once you’re up and running, explore the **Hardware**, **Software**, and **Gateware** sections as needed, depending on your project goals. Each section is designed to be self-contained, so you can dive into any area whenever you need more in-depth information.
